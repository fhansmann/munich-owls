Welcome to the repository for Munich Owls.

Munich Owls is a community project to create awareness for dangerous potholes and other obstacles on the streets with the primary goal to prevent accidents of any kind.

Our goal is build a community that cares about the safety of other traffic participants (e.g. cyclists, scooter riders, etc.) by providing real-time information on the state of local pathways.

This is also the my first independent web app of my portfolio. You can visit my portfolio website [here](https://www.florians.dev)
