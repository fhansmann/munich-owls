            We provide a current map of Munichâ€™s pathways showing dangerous
            spots. The spots have been marked by other community members. The
            little red owls serve as location markers and by clicking on them
            your received some additional information. Please note that
            everybody is able to see check out the owls at all times and there
            is no registration required.

          <Text fontSize="sm">
            Any spots that you personally come across and deem as dangerous for
            anyone using cycling paths (such as cyclists, scooter riders, etc.).
            The most obvious obstacles would be potholes but dangerous routing
            due to temporary construction work would be equally worth marking!

            Why did you built it?

          <Text fontSize="sm">
            We are a small team of creators and we are big cycling fans. We have
            seen many dangerous spots on the streets but lacked a platform to
            pass on this information effectively to others. Our goal is build a
            community that cares about the safety of others and provides &
            receives real-time information on the state of the local pathways.

            Why does it matter?

          <Text fontSize="sm">
            We love riding our bikes through the city and know that may other do
            so as well. In fact, cycling and other alternative means of
            individual transportation are increasingly popular, not just in
            Munich. Unfortunately, the streets are not always well-maintained
            posing a danger to people using these means. This is why we built
            Munich Owls.
